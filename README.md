# Abstract

In this work, we provide an in-depth overview of the RL framework and elucidate how its fundamental
concepts translate to the financial domain of portfolio optimization. It underscores the key advantages
of RL over traditional methods and sets the stage for a case study illustrating its effectiveness. This
dissertation explores the transformative potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the
realm of portfolio optimization in finance. It presents a comprehensive analysis of RL’s efficacy vis-
́a-vis traditional methodologies such as Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO). RL exhibits an intrinsic
ability to autonomously adapt to dynamic market conditions, marking a significant advancement over
classical approaches. It addresses critical limitations inherent in classical machine learning algorithms like
support vector machines and decision trees, notably their incapacity to capture non-linear relationships
and adaptability shortcomings. Through a real-world case study, this research showcases RL’s capacity to
attain superior risk-adjusted returns by dynamically adjusting portfolio strategies in response to evolving
market dynamics. By harnessing RL’s adaptability and learning capabilities, investors can navigate
intricate financial landscapes more effectively, maximizing returns while managing risk.

Keywords: `portfolio optimization`; `reinforcement learning`; `mean-variance optimization`; `Black-Litterman
model`; `supervised machine learning methods`; `deep learning`; `policy-gradient`; `Q-learning`.
