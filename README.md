# Abstract

This research explores how Reinforcement Learning (RL), a powerful AI technique, can revolutionize portfolio optimization in finance. Compared to traditional methods like Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), RL offers a significant advantage: its ability to learn and adapt to ever-changing market conditions. Unlike classical machine learning algorithms, RL can capture complex, non-linear relationships within financial data. To demonstrate this effectiveness, we present a real-world case study.  The case study showcases how RL can dynamically adjust portfolio strategies, leading to superior risk-adjusted returns.  By leveraging RL's adaptability and learning capabilities, investors can navigate the complexities of financial markets more effectively, achieving their investment goals.

Keywords: `portfolio optimization`; `reinforcement learning`; `mean-variance optimization`; `Black-Litterman
model`; `supervised machine learning methods`; `deep learning`; `policy-gradient`; `Q-learning`.
